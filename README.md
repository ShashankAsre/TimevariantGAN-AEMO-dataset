This Repository contains the execution of TimevariantGAN framework on energy dataset to generate synthetic energy data. The Original energy data is acquired from the "AEMO - Aggregated Price and Demand data" website (https://aemo.com.au/en/energy-systems/electricity/national-electricity-market-nem/data-nem/aggregated-data). Website contains monthly energy consumption data for various states of Australia. For this project, energy data is collected for whole 2020 year for the states Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania.

The repository contains –
•	One ‘.ipynb’ file named as “TimevariantGAN.ipynb”, 
•	Original energy dataset named as “energy_data.csv”
•	An output – Synthetic energy data, an excel file with annotation “Synthetic_energydata.xls” obtained from the execution of TimevariantGAN.
